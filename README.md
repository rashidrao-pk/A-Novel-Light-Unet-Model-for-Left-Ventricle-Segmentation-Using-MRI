# A-Novel-Light-Unet-Model-for-Left-Ventricle-Segmentation-Using-MRI
This repository showcases a collaborative project between a PhD student from Pakistan and i played the role of a co-supervisor aimed at enhancing the Unet model for improved computational efficiency and performance. By simplifying the model's complexity and optimizing its architecture, we developed a Light-Unet model that outperformed traditional models. Additionally, a summary of the paper "<a href='https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/11/14/3245'>A Novel Light U-Net Model for Left Ventricle Segmentation Using MRI</a>" is included, highlighting the innovative approach to left ventricle segmentation with MRI images.

### Contributions:
An image normalization method is performed prior to processing. The efficiencies of the proposed algorithm are strongly impacted by the enhancement of image contrast. Improving an imageâ€™s contrast is surely a prerequisite for image processing.
Intelligent Contrast Stretching and Histogram Equalization improves an image that has already undergone preprocessing with unsharp masking.
The Encoder path implanted layers with convolutional blocks and reducing the batch layer while in next layer removing the activation layer as well.
Afterward, up-sampling enlarges the feature batch back to its actual size. The significant contribution of the proposed technique is to provide 99% precise results of the epicardium layer.
The test dataset includes LVOT (Left Ventricle Outflow Tract) images of both endocardium and epicardium.
An analytic overview of previous research is depicted in further segments. Then, the novel contribution is introduced as an intelligent image enhancement technique that will not apply to all images from the dataset but only to the low-contrast images, which require preprocessing. Afterward, a novel deep learning model which utilizes the stock U-Net model as the backbone and is optimized to a lightweight model is mentioned along with its results and analytical discussion.
